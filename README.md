Project Introduction
This project is the beginning of a journey to create an AirBnB clone web application. The AirBnB clone will mimic the functionalities of the popular accommodation booking platform, starting with the fundamental aspects. This first step is crucial, as it forms the foundation upon which we will build the entire application. Our progress will involve HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.

Getting Started
Before you dive into the project, make sure to familiarize yourself with the AirBnB concept by visiting the AirBnB concept page to understand the objectives and functionalities of the platform.

Command Interpreter
What's a Command Interpreter?
The command interpreter is an essential component of this project. It's similar to a shell, but it's designed for a specific use-case. In our scenario, the command interpreter allows us to manage objects within the AirBnB project. You can use the command interpreter to perform the following actions:

Create a New Object: You can create new objects, such as a User or Place, within the AirBnB clone.

Retrieve an Object: Retrieve an object from a file, database, or any other data source. This is crucial for accessing information within our project.

Perform Operations on Objects: Utilize the command interpreter to perform operations on objects, such as counting or computing statistics.

Update Object Attributes: Modify and update attributes of an object, ensuring that the data is up to date and accurate.

Destroy an Object: Remove or delete an object from the system when it's no longer needed.

Project Structure
To achieve the objectives mentioned above, the project is structured as follows:

BaseModel: A parent class that handles the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.

Serialization Flow: A simplified flow of serialization and deserialization that involves converting instances to dictionaries, JSON strings, and file storage.

Classes: All classes required for AirBnB objects, such as User, State, City, Place, and more. These classes inherit from BaseModel.

Storage Engine: The first abstracted storage engine of the project, which focuses on file storage.

Unit Tests: Comprehensive unit tests are provided to validate the functionality and correctness of all our classes and the storage engine.

Running Tests
To ensure the correctness and reliability of our code, we have included a suite of unit tests. You can run these tests to verify that the project components are functioning as expected. Simply execute the test suite with the following command:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover tests

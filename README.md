AirBnB Clone Project README
Welcome to the AirBnB Clone Project!
Project Description
The AirBnB Clone Project is the first step towards building a full-fledged web application that emulates the core functionality of Airbnb. In this initial stage, we will be developing a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects. This is a crucial foundation for the entire project, as it will be used in conjunction with various other components, such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API development, and front-end integration.

Project Goals
The key objectives of this project are as follows:

Implement a parent class called BaseModel, responsible for the initialization, serialization, and deserialization of future instances.

Create a simple flow for serialization and deserialization, which includes converting between instances, dictionaries, JSON strings, and file storage.

Develop specific classes for AirBnB objects (e.g., User, State, City, Place) that inherit from the BaseModel class.

Build the initial abstracted storage engine of the project, known as File Storage.

Create a suite of unit tests to validate all classes and the storage engine.

What's a Command Interpreter?
The Command Interpreter is a crucial component of the AirBnB Clone Project. It is a text-based interface that allows users to manage objects within the project. It provides the following functionality:

Create: Users can create new objects, such as a new User or a new Place, using this command interpreter.

Retrieve: It allows users to retrieve objects from various data sources, such as files or databases.

Operations: Users can perform operations on objects, including counting, computing statistics, and more.

Update: Users can update attributes of an existing object.

Destroy: The command interpreter provides the ability to delete or destroy objects.

How to Start the Command Interpreter
To start the AirBnB Clone Project's Command Interpreter, follow these steps:

Clone the project repository from GitHub.

Navigate to the project directory using your terminal.

Run the command interpreter by executing the main script: ./console.py.

How to Use the Command Interpreter
The command interpreter provides a prompt where you can enter various commands to interact with AirBnB objects. The basic syntax for commands is as follows:

scss
Copy code
(command) (options)
Here are some example commands:

create User: Creates a new User object.
show User 1234-5678: Displays details of the User with the specified ID.
update Place 9876-5432 attribute value: Updates an attribute of a Place object with the specified ID.
The command interpreter will provide feedback and output in response to your commands.

Examples
Here are a few examples of how to use the command interpreter:

Create a User:

sql
Copy code
(command) create User
Show Object Details:

sql
Copy code
(command) show User 1234-5678
Update Object Attribute:

bash
Copy code
(command) update Place 9876-5432 name New Name
Destroy an Object:

bash
Copy code
(command) destroy State 8765-4321
Feel free to explore the command interpreter and its capabilities further to manage and interact with AirBnB objects effectively.
